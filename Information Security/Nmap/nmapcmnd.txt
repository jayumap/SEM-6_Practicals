Nmap commands 

Localhost check for opened ports:
nmap localhost

Scan remote host 8.8.8.8 for all open port TCP ports:
nmap 8.8.8.8

OS Fingerprinting
OS fingerprinting:

sudo nmap -O

if they block your ping probes you can do:
sudo nmap -O <target> -Pn

Sometimes you still get fake results and you should try doing an aggressive scan (can be detected and blocked by the firewall).
sudo nmap -A <target>


Nmap to find all hosts by defining an IP range from 1 to 255 (1-255).
nmap -sP 
192.168.18.1-255


How to find a Live host
Type “-sP” to scan a list of all live and up hosts:
sudo nmap -sP 192.168.18.*



Open Port Scan:
To scan for open ports on a target system, use the following command:
nmap -p- <target_ip>
This command will scan all ports on the target system and report which ones are open.

OS Fingerprinting:
To perform OS fingerprinting on a target system, use the following command:
nmap -O <target_ip>
This command will attempt to identify the operating system running on the target system.

Ping Scan:
To perform a ping scan on a target system, use the following command:
nmap -sn <target_ip>
This command will send an ICMP echo request to the target system and report if it receives a response.

TCP Port Scan:
To scan for open TCP ports on a target system, use the following command:
nmap -sS <target_ip>
This command will perform a SYN scan, which sends a SYN packet to each port and waits for a response. If a SYN/ACK packet is received, the port is considered open.

UDP Port Scan:
To scan for open UDP ports on a target system, use the following command:
nmap -sU <target_ip>
This command will send a UDP packet to each port and wait for a response. If a response is received, the port is considered open.
